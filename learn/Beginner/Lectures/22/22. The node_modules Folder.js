// Creating Our First NPM Package

// Create a new directory for your package and navigate to it in your terminal.

// Run npm init to create a package.json file that will store metadata about your package. 
// This file will include information like the package name, version, description, author, and dependencies.

// Create the files that make up your package. These files should be organized according 
// to the standard Node.js module structure.

// If your package has any dependencies, add them to the dependencies or
// devDependencies section of your package.json file.

// (Optional) Create a README.md file to document your package.

// Publish your package to the NPM registry using npm publish.

// To publish your package to the NPM registry, you'll need to create an account on the NPM website
// (https://www.npmjs.com/). Once you've created an account, you can run npm login to authenticate with the registry.

// After you've logged in, you can run npm publish to publish your package to the registry.
// Once your package is published, others can install it using npm install your-package-name.
