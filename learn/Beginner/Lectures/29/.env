# An env file is a text file that contains environment variables that can be loaded into a project's environment.
# It's a way to store sensitive information and configuration settings outside of the codebase,
# making it easier to manage and maintain different environments (e.g., development, staging, production)
# without exposing any sensitive data.

# In a Node.js project, the dotenv package can be used to load environment variables from an
# env file into the process.env object. The package parses the file and
# sets the variables in the current process's environment.

# To use dotenv in a Node.js project, follow these steps:
# Install dotenv using npm:
# npm install dotenv

# Create an env file with the environment variables you want to use:
# PORT=3000

# In your Node.js file, require dotenv at the top of your file:
# require('dotenv').config()

# Use the environment variables in your code:
# const port = process.env.port;


port = 3000
