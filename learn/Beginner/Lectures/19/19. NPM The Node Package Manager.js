// NPM: The Node Package Manager

// some of the key features of NPM

// Dependency Management: NPM provides a way to manage dependencies for your Node.js projects. 
// You can specify dependencies in your package.json file, and NPM will download and install them automatically.

// Versioning: NPM allows you to specify version ranges for your dependencies, 
// so you can ensure that your project is using compatible versions of all the libraries it depends on.

// Registry: NPM has a public registry of packages that you can search and download from. 
// You can also publish your own packages to the registry to share with the community.

// Scripts: NPM allows you to define custom scripts in your package.json file that can be run using the npm run command. 
// This is useful for tasks like running tests or building your project.

// Global Packages: NPM allows you to install packages globally, so they can be used across all your projects. 
// This is useful for tools like nodemon or eslint that you may want to use in multiple projects.
